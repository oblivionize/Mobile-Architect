# Mobile-Architect


    • Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
        The goal of this app is to track an inventory of items. You can add, delete, and update the quantity of items. It should also send sms notifications when the quanity of an item is low. It also needed a login screen.
    
    • What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
        The required screens were a login screen, an inventory list screen, and a settings screen. I tried to make the UI as simple as possible for users so that it wouldn't require training in its use. My designs were simple and minimilistic for this reason.
    
    • How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
        When coding my app I followed an iterative approach. I worked on individual segments at a time and tested each one as I went. I think this approach could serve me well, since iterative development seems to be the best way to go.
    
    • How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
        Anytime I programmed a function I would test the app to make sure it worked the way I wanted it to. Catching errors before you move on to something else helps you to figure out where errors are located.
    
    • Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
        I thought the login screen was the most challenging. I had to do a lot of research on SQL databases in order to store the info correctly.
    
    • In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
        The main inventory page works really well and I am happy that it works as well as it does. It can successfully add and delete items from the list.
